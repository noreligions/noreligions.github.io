Freethought, Humanism and Atheism. 

Author of the books “Liberated from Religion” and “Wasting Time on God”, Paulo Bittencourt was born in Paraná, Brazil, spent his childhood in Rio de Janeiro and studied Theology in São Paulo. Close to becoming a pastor, he had doubts, dropped out of college, ventured through Europe and ended up settling in Austria. The book “Ethics”, by Bento de Espinosa (Baruch Spinoza), strengthened his skepticism and consolidated him as a freethinker.
